        Habits shape our identity and become automatic over time. see our phone when we're bored or
        apologizing every time we ask a question are Examples of habits that become instinctive. Our
        brain learns signals and acts accordingly. unconscious way. If we want to start a new habit,
        it is important to establish a signal or a routine that makes us more aware. For example, if
        we sit at the table where we always eat, we are more likely to feel hungry. If we make our
        habits of unconsciously, things become easier. It is also useful to record our habits to be
        more aware of our bad habits and be able to work on them. Is It is important to specify the
        time and place to start a habit, since we are creating a environment and a signal that helps
        us remember our intention. We can create a "stack" of habits, for example, after exercising,
        meditate, and after meditating, take a cold shower.

      <TextBodyOne>
        The environment also plays an important role in the creation of habits, since many times we
        do things simply because they are accessible or easy to acquire. For example, if not we have
        a book in hand, we are less likely to start reading. It is important to be a designer of our
        world and not just a consumer within it.

        This topic is quite complex, but I will try to summarize it in the simplest way possible.
        Dopamine is the neurotransmitter that motivates us to do the things we want and is
        associated with the sensation of pleasure. When we think of something we want, like a
        cookie, we release dopamine, which makes us feel good and motivates us to go for it. if the
        cookie is delicious, we release even more dopamine, which reinforces the behavior of
        reaching for it again. This applies to many things, like watching videos, playing video
        games, eating junk food. All these activities have in common that they do not require much
        effort. On the other hand, developing new skills or exercising can be anything but. A form
        of approach this is by using the formula "AFTER [CURRENT HABITS], I will do [HABIT THAT I
        NEED]", which will help us motivate ourselves and create new habits. In general, our
        Motivations are usually for these reasons:
      </TextBodyOne>

        <TextList>Conserve energy.</TextList>
        <TextList>Get food and water.</TextList>
        <TextList>Find love and reproduce.</TextList>
        <TextList>Connect and create emotional bonds with other people. </TextList>

        <TextList>Reduce uncertainty.</TextList>
        <TextList>Achieve high status and prestige.</TextList>
      </TextListBoxDesorder>
      <TextBodyOne>This is an example of how basic human motivations can be hacked:</TextBodyOne>
      <TextListBoxDesorder>
        <TextList>Get food and water. = Junk Food</TextList>
        <TextList>Find love and reproduce. = Watch videos +18</TextList>
        <TextList>Connect and create emotional bonds with other people. = Browse Facebook</TextList>
        <TextList>Gain social acceptance and approval = Post a photo on a social network</TextList>
        <TextList>Reduce uncertainty = Search for information on Google</TextList>
        <TextList>Achieving high status and prestige = Playing video games</TextList>
      </TextListBoxDesorder>
      <TextBodyOne>
        All of these activities can release large amounts of dopamine, making them in supernormal
        stimuli that drive us to repeat them. However, these habits are easy to acquire, while good
        habits seem to be more difficult to maintain. One possible solution is to emphasize the
        long-term benefits of good habits and associate them with positive feelings. In this way,
        good habits can become more attractive and motivate us to keep them.

      <TextBodyOne>
        Well, in my opinion, the title of the text suggests what the topic will be about. To the
        humans we like to conserve energy, so if we want to develop a habit, we must do It doesn't
        last long at first. Once it becomes automatic, we can increase gradually the duration. If a
        habit is easy to develop, you are more likely to do it. let's repeat To prevent a bad habit
        from repeating itself, it is important to make it completely impossible to do. Also, taking
        action is better than just planning. To the take action, there is a risk of failure, but by
        failing we learn, and the more we learn, the better we become in our actions.

      <HeadlineThree>4. Make it satisfying</HeadlineThree>
      <br />
      <TextBodyOne>
        We like instant gratification and effortless pleasure. Therefore, when you break a habit,
        make sure that it is satisfying and that you feel successful. It is also useful to keep
        track of your habits, as this gives you a sense of progress, and progress makes us happy.
        It's normal if you can't keep your habit sometimes, you may be sick or some unexpected
        circumstance happens. However, don't let this happen more than twice.
