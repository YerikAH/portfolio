        I have been devoting time to my training lately, which has led me to acquire Basic knowledge
        about nutrition. I have researched topics such as weight loss and muscle development. I
        remember I used to believe that just drinking water and eating "food healthy" would lose
        weight. However, I realized that I was consuming a lot of false information on the Internet
        and, as a result, failed on many occasions. Recently, I have started a new phase of
        definition and it seems that I have forgotten aspects very important. For this reason, I
        have decided to write this blog to share my experience on how to lose weight. It is
        important to note that what I will share is just my personal experience and that if it
        doesn't work for you, it's completely fine. Also, I want to clarify that I am not a doctor
        or nutritionist, I only rely on some scientific investigations.

      <HeadlineThree>1. Caloric deficit</HeadlineThree>
      <TextBodyOne>
        Every food has calories, except water. Humans need calories to survive. You can think of it
        this way: Imagine you are a car and you need Gasoline to run, just like a human being needs
        calories. However, to Unlike car tires, humans have a limit of calories. If we consume more
        calories than we need, we will store them as fat. On the other hand, if we eat fewer
        calories than we need, we will burn fat.
        <br />
        <br />
        It is important to understand that if we eat the right amount of calories, we will not gain
        or we will lose weight So yes, it is possible to lose weight even if you eat hamburgers and
        chocolates, as long as you know the calories they contain and include them in your daily
        intake. To calculate the amount of calories you need, you can use some calculators available
        online. It is important to note that you will need a balance of foods to accurately measure
        portions. I think if I had had one before and If I had counted all the calories, my process
        would have been faster.

      <HeadlineThree>2. Make it easy</HeadlineThree>
      <TextBodyOne>
        I definitely remember losing weight before and failing in many ways. occasions. I ate more
        calories than I needed and constantly felt hungry, at least that's what i thought Every time
        I left my room, I would end up snacking on something in the kitchen. Also, if I had
        chocolates at home, it was too easy to be tempted and eat them. Strangely, after realizing
        that I had "failed", it seemed that my appetite increased even more. <br />
        <br /> One day, after an incredible failure, I said to myself: "God, what the hell am I
        doing?" doing?" It was at that moment that I decided to throw away the food, although I now
        recognize that It wasn't the right way to approach it. The next day, after losing
        motivation, I left my room and, to my surprise, I was not distracted by food. I focused on
        doing what I had to do out of my room and then I went back to my space. I didn't think about
        food simply because I couldn't see any food within my reach. If he wanted to eat, he
        required effort, and the human being generally avoids effort because it implies spending
        energy. Our instinct tells us: "we need to save energy". The point is not to throw away
        food, but to make it less accessible. Let me give you a small example: if you like the nuts,
        place them in a high place that is not in the kitchen, in a distant place. Of In this way,
        you will think twice before going to look for those nuts that you want so much. <br />{' '}
        <br /> Also, I want to highlight another important point, if you want to eat healthier: make
        making unhealthy food less accessible, and making healthy food accessible. Rather buy junk
        food, opt for good quality food and have it available at home. This means changing your
        shopping habits and filling your pantry with more nutritious. By having healthy foods easily
        accessible, it will be easier for you to make smart choices and avoid being tempted by
        unhealthy food. Although it may seem insignificant, believe me that this change can make a
        big difference. difference in your lifestyle and your weight loss goals.

      <HeadlineThree>3. Drink water</HeadlineThree>
      <TextBodyOne>
        I remember that I used to drink a lot of water and I believed that it helped me lose weight.
        Actually, I think I lost weight not from drinking water directly, but because I felt full.
        To the being well hydrated, my feeling of hunger decreased. So the next time you I ate, it
        was much easier for me to eat less, since I was satisfied with portions smaller. <br />{' '}
        <br /> By the way, I did some research and found that this strategy is similar to what some
        anorexics use. I want to clarify that I am not saying that it is correct to be anorexic, I
        just found that fact curious. It's important to have on mind that it is not a matter of
        drinking excess water, but of consuming the necessary amount.

      <HeadlineFour>My Story</HeadlineFour>
      <TextBodyOne>
        I learned about fasting through videos on the internet. In general, he did not apply it
        because he believed that he should eat three times a day. However, when I reduced my intake
        to two meals and I practiced a 12 hour fast, everything was fine. I did not die, I did not
        have gastritis or I experienced no similar problem. I started with a 12 hour fast and then
        moved on to fasting of 16 hours. Over time, I have come to practice fasting for 20 hours and
        even 24 hours. sometimes. I remember that at first it was difficult for me. I was hungry and
        could not resist the urge to eat, which led to many failures. One of the main mistakes it
        was that my fasts were too long or I did not have a proper eating schedule. The The solution
        I found was to eat a larger amount of food in one meal and establish specific hours in which
        he could eat. This was easier for me because I sleep for 8 hours, and when I sleep, I don't
        go to the kitchen to eat.

        Without a doubt, I believe that exercising has many benefits, both mentally and physical.

      <HeadlineFour>My Story</HeadlineFour>
      <TextBodyOne>
        In fact, exercise was the first thing I got into. i remember i used to do exercise for three
        hours straight, and of course, that was not sustainable in the long run. At that time, I did
        not understand key concepts such as discipline and habits, not even I knew about them. I
        think that's what caused a lot of my failures. But managed to maintain a "healthy" diet,
        ended up overeating and stopped do exercise. After going six months without seeing any
        significant progress and feeling the same as before, I decided to give up. I thought I would
        never try to lose weight again.
        <br />
        <br />A little time passed, I felt bad, and suddenly, on January 4, 2021, I got tired. felt
        a strange energy, something he had never experienced before. With some anger, I said out
        loud high that I didn't care if I failed, that I would exercise every day. I didn't care if
        I ate more than usual, because when I got control back, I would stop. passed a week and I
        failed, but instead of feeling sadness as usual, I felt anger. I told myself Same as no, I
        didn't care anymore. Automatically, I started exercising again and I got my motivation back.

      <TextBodyOne>
        When I wrote this, I realized that I was telling more about my failures. I didn't do it to
        purpose, it just is. You may be tired of this being repeated to you, but it's true: when you
        fail, you learn. We are not gods or perfect beings, so it is normal to commit mistakes. When
        I fail and I am aware of it, I do everything possible to avoid going back to fail. I look at
        it this way: every hour is a battle. I can win or my other self, the one that seek pleasure
        without effort. If I fail a battle, I still have fifteen more to go. Even in the worst case,
        if I fail ten times (I lose ten battles), at least I try to win the six remaining battles.
        This is certainly a broad subject and, in my learning process, These videos have been very
        helpful to me:

        <TextList>
          It's not about time: Stopping eating doesn't take time, in fact, it saves you time.
          Exercising does take time, but even with just 90 minutes a week, which is the minimal but
          sufficient, it is possible.

        <TextList>
          Do not rely on motivation alone: In the end, the motivation will fade and you will not be
          able to do what you need to do. You can use motivation to initiate action, but when Don't
          feel like doing it, resort to discipline. Or just make it easier: get out of bed and
          exercise, run a few laps. Just do it, it doesn't matter if you don't you sweat a lot or it
          wasn't an intense workout.{' '}
        </TextList>
        <TextList>
          Lack of self-awareness and self-control: I still fail in these aspects, but in a nutshell,
          yes. you don't have a bit of self-control, you'll end up overeating (and possibly
          procrastinating too much). Don't worry though, you can develop self-control. It's up to
          you to figure out how to gain awareness and improve your self-control. ask yourself same
          how to achieve it.

        <TextList>
          If you failed to eat, it doesn't mean you shouldn't exercise. In fact, you should

        In fact, I don't want to use those tired words that are used today, but I I found them. At
        the time, I didn't know much about its definition. when i started exercise daily and stopped
        worrying about mistakes, I discovered constancy. When I didn't feel like exercising but
        still did, I found the discipline. All this required effort, I even had to sacrifice a few
        items of clothing (joke). The idea here is that you encounter all kinds of emotions,
        feelings and values. From my point of view From sight, that's what makes it exciting, since
        it's something new. The new causes mystery, fear and uncertainty. On the contrary, the old

      <TextBodyOne>
        The caloric deficit is key. Eating less than we need burns fat. Make it easy: make unhealthy
        food less accessible and have healthy options on hand. Drinking water reduces hunger.
        Intermittent fasting can help. Exercise improves physical and mentally. Failing is normal,
        learn from it. The perseverance, effort, sacrifice and controls are necessary. Change your
        habits in the long term to have lasting results.
