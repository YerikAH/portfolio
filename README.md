## Development 
### Project structure

Important Folders:
- **public:** This folder contains almost all the files used by the application, and is consumed by useFetch.tsx.
- **src:**
  - **assets**: Files also used in the application.
  - **components**: All the components are here.
  - **constants:** Constant variables to avoid hard coding.
  - **context:** Contexts are here, including useFetch which provides data to the other components that need it.
  - **enum:** Enums.
  - **helpers:** Most of the logic is here.
  - **hook:** The only custom hook, useFetch.tsx.
  - **interface:** Interfaces to be more explicit.
  - **styles:** All the styles used, mostly or almost all of them are .ts files.

### My experience developing
I think this was the project that took me the longest, I used a lot of libraries and learned a lot of things. I reuse some components that I already had from other projects which helped me a lot in the development process (customHook, DataContext), This project helped me a lot when creating interfaces, creating helpers, on the other hand what was a bit confusing for me was the project structure since at first I thought it would not be a lot of work, and I would develop it in a simple way, but after a lot of development, I didn't know what project structure to handle, but I think  looks good. By the way, in the development of this project I learned a little more about the configuration of TypeScript, ESLint, and Prettier, to handle the code in a slightly cleaner way.
